### Key Concepts and Tools 

* Math 
    *  Algebra
        *  Variables
        *  coefficients 
        *  functions 
        * Linear equations 
            * $y = b + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2$ 
        * Logarithms
            * logarithmic equations
                * $y = ln(1+ e^z)$
        * Sigmoid function 
    * Linear algebra
        * Tensor 
            * Tensor rank
        * Matrix multiplication
    * Trigonometry 
        * Tanh (discussed as an activation function; no prior knowledge needed)
    * Statistics
        * Mean
        * Median
        * Outliers 
        * Standard deviaion 
        * histogram(Ability to read a histogram) 
    * Calculus (optional, for advanced topics)
    * Concept of a derivative (you won't have to actually calculate derivatives)
    * Gradient (or slope )
    * Partial derivatives (which are closely related to gradients)
    * Chain rule (for a full understanding of the backpropagation algorithm for training neural networks)
    *
